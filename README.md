## 📌 What This App Is (and Isn’t)

### ✅ This **is**:
- A fast way to drill hiragana on your phone
- A zero-setup learning tool
- A single-file web app you fully own

### ❌ This **is not**:
- A spaced-repetition system (like Anki)
- A cloud-synced app
- A full Japanese language course

It’s intentionally simple.
